With AR, you can scale down from XXHDPI, which can be useful in a few ways. When creating new assets the benefits are obvious, simply create your XXHDPI assets and scale them down straight into your project.\r\n\r\nIt can also be useful when adding new assets into a project. Instead of getting the new assets for each density and dragging them into each DPI folder, simply drag your XXHDPI asset into it’s folder then run AndroidResizer again to re-scale the folder down.\r\n\r\n_NOTE: You may want to back up your assets before running this tool. In the unlikely event that all of your assets get rekt, I will not be held responsible._\r\n\r\n####Changelog:-\r\n\r\n#####1.4\r\nQuick release since someone requested this in the project issues:\r\n- Added XXXHDPI support\r\n\r\nI'll try to get another version out soon with some more features, and I've come up with an idea for 9-patch support which I'll be attempting to implement soon! Also hoping to get iOS support in the next release, along with the new GUI.\r\n\r\n#####1.3\r\nBeen a bit lazy recently with this, but the project is progressing!\r\nYou should find v1.3 in the releases tab, ready to go.\r\n\r\n- Added directory serialization (The program now remembers your last used input directory)\r\n- Added input density choice via combobox\r\n- Fixed TVDPI scaling (checkbox is still unselected by default, as TVDPI is rarely used)\r\n- Fixed rare \"Directory is null!\" bug\r\n- \"Copy XXHDPI with prefix\" is now \"Copy origin prefix\", and works with all densities.\r\n- Added notification beep on resizing completion\r\n- Minor misc. bugs\r\n\r\n#####1.2.2\r\n- Fixed XXHDPI copying scaling down to ldpi\r\n- Fixed some output\r\n- Fixed scaling issue for images with no alpha channel \r\n\r\n#####1.2.1\r\n- Added EXE generation\r\n- Added new icons & images\r\n- Updated DMG generation\r\n- Changed to Nimbus L&F\r\n- Made directory field manually editable\r\n- Disable/enable directory field when sizing is in progress/complete\r\n- Removed some unused files/code\r\n\r\n#####1.2\r\n- Added custom prefix for use with non-standard Android Resource structures (Titanium, PhoneGap etc.)\r\n- Added some tooltips\r\n- Altered some text output to fit with the new prefixing feature\r\n- Added XXHDPI Copy\r\n- Cleaned up variable names\r\n- Disable/enable all controls when sizing is in progress/complete\r\n\r\n#####1.1.1\r\n- Stability improvements\r\n- Output improvements\r\n- Fixed progress bar bug\r\n\r\n#####1.1\r\n- Added JPEG and GIF support (Animation not currently supported)\r\n- Improved scaling operations\r\n\r\n#####1.0.1\r\n- Added multi-threading to provide user feedback while processing images\r\n- Added ability to choose which DPI outputs to generate\r\n- Fixed transparency issues\r\n\r\n#####1.0\r\n- Initial Release\r\n- Scale all PNG images in an XXHDPI folder and save them to all lower DPI's (L, M, TV, H, XH)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n######PLANNED FEATURES\r\n- iOS support\r\n- Single file support\r\n- ~~Scale from other densities~~\r\n- Basic upscaling\r\n- Updated design\r\n- SVG support\r\n- Seperate source/destination folders\r\n- Multiple project configurations\r\n- XXXHDPI support\r\n- 9-patch support\r\n- Generation Wizard\r\n- Build-step integration\r\n\r\n<sup><sup><sup><sup><sup><sup><sup><sup><span style=\"color:white\">Android Image Resizing Asset Resizer Density Scale LDPI MDPI HDPI TVDPI XHDPI XXHDPI XXXHDPI DPI  Resource Res</span></sup></sup></sup></sup></sup></sup></sup></sup>\r\n\r\nREFERENCE\r\n---\r\n\r\nFrom [a great StackOverflow post about android densities](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/11581649/about-android-image-size-and-assets-sizes)\r\n\r\nmdpi is the reference density -- that is, 1 px on an mdpi display is equal to 1 dip. The ratio for asset scaling is:\r\n\r\nldpi | mdpi | tvdpi | hdpi | xhdpi | xxhdpi | xxxhdpi\r\n--- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | ---\r\n0.75 | 1       | 1.33  | 1.5   | 2        | 3           | 4\r\n\r\nAlthough you don't really need to worry about tvdpi unless you're developing specifically for Google TV or the original Nexus 7 -- but even Google recommends simply using hdpi assets.\r\n\r\nWhat this means is if you're doing a 48dip image and plan to support up to xhdpi resolution, you should start with a 96px image (144px if you want native assets for xxhdpi) and make the following images for the densities:\r\n\r\nldpi       | mdpi     | tvdpi     | hdpi      | xhdpi      | xxhdpi      | xxxhdpi\r\n--- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | ---\r\n36 x 36 | 48 x 48 | 64 x 64  | 72 x 72 | 96 x 96   | 144 x 144 | 192 x 192\r\n\r\nAnd these should display at roughly the same size on any device, provided you've placed these in density-specific folders (e.g. drawable-xhdpi, drawable-hdpi, etc.)\t\r\n\r\nFor reference, the pixel densities for these are:\r\n\r\nldpi   | mdpi  | tvdpi  | hdpi  | xhdpi  | xxhdpi  | xxxhdpi\r\n--- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | ---\r\n120   | 160     | 213    | 240   | 320     | 480       | 640\r\n\r\n\r\n![alt tag](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/BlitzKraig/AndroidResizer/master/src/androidresizer/Resizer.png)\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
